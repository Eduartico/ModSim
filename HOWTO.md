# HOWTO

## Prerequisites

- Python: The project is developed using Python. Ensure Python (preferably Python 3.x) is installed.
- Mesa: The project uses the Mesa framework for agent-based simulation. Version 2.4.0 is used as it was the most recent
version when the project started, and the current version no longer supports the same functions. 
Install it via pip: pip install mesa==2.4.0
- numpy: pip install numpy
- matplotlib: pip install matplotlib
- pandas: pip install pandas
